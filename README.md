# karpathy-micrograd
A big fan of [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy). I'm going to copy the entire code from this [repository](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), so maybe one day I'll be half as smart as him :)

It's my first experimental try, and if it turns out successful, I'll continue exploring projects by Karpathy and other brilliant minds.
